<H1>Resource Constrained Project Scheduling</H1>

<P> This data set, and its associated series of problems, is based
upon large scale assembly but is applicable to a wide variety of
problems in engineering, construction, and manufacturing that can
generally be described as resource constrained project
scheduling. This same data set and series of problems could have
originated from a commercial construction project, a petro-chemical
plant start-up, an automotive assembly line set-up, Space Shuttle
reprocessing, or the assembly of heavy machine tools. I have prepared
a first series of problems based upon this data set. Time permitting,
I will prepare additional problems that are based upon this same data
set or prepare additional data sets that can be the subject of this
same series of problems.</P>

<P> In brief summary, this series of problems is based upon the most
common questions raised by production management. The capabilities
demonstrated in the solution of these problems can be used to answer
the following:</P>

<UL>

<LI>If there were no resource constraints, how long would this work
take?  (Problem 1)</LI> 

<LI>If we had unlimited labor resources, how long would this work take?
 (Problem 2)</LI> 

<LI>How much labor should we allocate in order to meet our delivery
schedule? (Problem 12)</LI> 

<LI>Given a fixed labor budget and a specific policy on how the work is
to be managed, how long will this work take? (Problem 3 and 4)</LI>
 
<LI>How can we accommodate new work without perturbing existing plans
and schedules? What is the earliest that I can complete the new work? 
(Problem 5) How long can I delay the new work? (Problem 6)</LI> 

<LI>Things haven't gone exactly as planned. Is there any impact on our
promised delivery? (Problem 7) Or do we need to call in some overtime
(Problem 8)?</LI> 

<LI>It looks like we need to support another project. Can we divert
some labor without impact on our promised delivery (Problem 9) Or can we
adjust our schedule and compensate with some overtime (Problem 10)?</LI>

<LI>Can we use some of our excess labor to start the production of
another assembly without impact on our promised delivery of the current
assembly? (Problem 11)?</LI> 

<LI>What delivery schedule can we promise our customers when we go
into regular production (Problem 12)?</LI>

<H1>The Focus</H1>	

<P> You will notice that every problem in the first series requires
the construction of a schedule, and that the primary focus seems to be
on producing "optimal" schedules, but taken as a whole the first
series of problems represents an entirely different sort of
challenge. My experience is that less than 1% of the code in a working
scheduling application is devoted to schedule optimization. The
remainder of the code is devoted to a diverse collection of functions
required to make the application useful and user-friendly (graphical
user interface, postscript reports, etc.) By similar measure, less
than 5% of the time spent scheduling is making new schedules while 95%
of the time is spent revising and maintaining schedules in the context
of daily progress and changing assumptions.  Hence, the real emphasis
in the first series of problems is upon having a complete collection
of schedule construction and maintenance capabilities that can be used
to directly support production management.  These problems exercise a
scheduling engine with many of the very same challenges that it would
encounter if deployed in a real production environment.</P>

<P> Even though the emphasis is not upon optimization, it is still
necessary to produce good solutions to these problems. When a customer
has a choice of systems that provide equivalent functionality, they
will always choose the one that produces better schedules. However
each industry and application has a different measure of quality. In
the following problems, the focus is on minimal cycle time but in the
actual factory setting there are a large number of other, sometimes
subjective, measures of quality that must be respected. These other
factors are not part of this first series of problems only to keep its
scope limited and focused.</P>

<P> When measuring the quality of a schedule, it is important to agree
not only upon the metric for comparison but also upon the standard for
comparing two metric results. Traditional statistical measures can be
used effectively to determine when two scheduling methods consistently
produce different results but this should not be confused with what
end users perceive to be a significant difference. In this, and other
similar applications, a day is the smallest significant time quantum.
This is because so many other aspects of production, like the start of
a new assembly or the delivery of parts, are aligned on day
boundaries.  Two schedules that differ by a few minutes or a few hours
will not be significantly different. In such settings, a schedule must
be at least 1 day better in order to be significantly better, but a 1
day difference can be worth $100,000 or even $1,000,000.  It will be
noticeable that this first series of problems is devoid of any
"interesting" constraints or situations. In this data set there are
only two kinds of constraints, resource and precedence. And we explore
only one kind of resource usage.  At a later time I hope to publish
additional data sets that explore other technical issues including
interruption and preemption, placement preferences, resource modeling,
and state constraints.  </P>

<H1>The Challenge</H1>	

<p> To some extent, the twelve problems given below are arranged
according to progressive difficulty. Problem 1 is concerned only with
precedence while Problem 2 is concerned with both precedence and
resource constraints. But Problem 2 and Problem 3 are qualitatively
quite different. Problem 2 can be solved with a scheduling engine that
possesses no lookahead but Problem 3 requires sufficient lookahead to
accurately schedule within shift boundaries. Problem 4 requires the
ability to look past the shift boundaries so long as sufficient
resources are available. Problem 5 requires the ability to look beyond
shift boundaries and to perform scheduling within the context of some
existing, but irregular pattern of resource availability. Problem 6
requires essentially the same capability but may prove to be
prohibitively difficult for scheduling engines that perform purely
chronological schedule construction. Problem 7 exercises a scheduling
engine's ability to perform incremental schedule modifications, while
Problem 8 exercises a system's ability to constrain its operations to
specific windows of time. Problems 9 and 10 are similar but might
prove difficult for systems that rely upon hard coded models of
resource availability rather than explicit data
representations. Problem 11 again looks much like Problem 4 but tests
whether the scheduling engine can be constrained in its effects while
still pursuing an optimization goal. And finally Problem 12 exercises
the scalability of a scheduling engine and at the same time tests
whether a scheduling engine can simultaneously optimize multiple
objectives.</P>

<p> You will find that the problems in the first series require quite
a variety of capabilities. It is not necessary that 100% of the work
required to solve a problem be automated, but participants are
expected to report on what parts of the solution process were
accomplished through data manipulation and commands issued to their
scheduling system. To be honest, the only thing that counts is the
ability to produce good solutions to these problems in a
cost-effective and timely fashion. Combinations of manual and
automated methods will always be necessary to adapt to the
continuously changing manufacturing environment.</P>

<P> Some participants will find the complete series of problems to be
prohibitively difficult. Others will find them to be within their
capability. In the end, the number and kind of solutions submitted
will substantially influence perceptions of what constitutes the
state-of-the-practice and the state-of-the-art. At the same time, the
number and kind of solutions submitted will influence the level of
difficulty in subsequent benchmark problems.</P>

<P>I recognize that most participants will be reluctant to publish
their results without some knowledge of what others have
accomplished. To reduce such anxiety, my partner in this endeavour,
Mark Ringer, has agreed to work the first 4 problems with a simple
first fit, interval based scheduling engine, with no optimization. His
results are summarized in the section on results submitted by
participants. I hope that all participants will report as many results
as possible so that we can begin to determine what is a reasonable
level of capability in addition to what is an achievable level of
capability.</P>

<H1>The Physical Problem</H1>

<P> The physical problem, which this abstract data set represents, is
the process of creating a large assembly consisting of a large number
of discrete steps. Each step entails the performance of specific work
documented in formal process plans. We can assume that the activity
name, consisting of an assembly number followed by a step number,
uniquely identifies each step and provides an unambiguous link to the
formal process plans.  This data set contains only the information
required to schedule the work and all other information necessary for
the performance of the work is found elsewhere. The duration of each
step is annotated in hours and minutes and the work has been divided
so that no single step requires more than 1 shift (7.5 hours) for its
performance. Each step requires zero or more individuals drawn from 4
labor pools, Px, Py, Pz, and Pw, to be present for the full
duration. While performing a step these individuals and their
supporting equipment may occupy or exclusively reserve space within
designated work-zones (Za, Zb, etc.) around the assembly.</P>

<P>This data set was synthesized from actual assembly problems and,
based upon my experience, is perfectly realistic. However the specific
names, durations, labor, zone, and precedence constraints have all
been created to make this problem entirely unique, and dissimilar from
any real assembly. Hence, labor is named by anonymous pools Px, Py,
Pz, and Pw, work zones around the assembly are named Za, Zb, etc., and
the steps are designated by a two part name consisting of an anonymous
assembly number and an anonymous step number. In addition, the step
numbers have been randomized so that there is no correlation between
step number and precedence.</P>

<H1>The Data File</H1>

<P>The data set, consisting of four parts, contains all of the data
required in the graduated series of problems described below. The
format for the data was chosen not for its generality or
expressiveness, but rather for its simplicity so that minimal effort
would be required in the creation of readers and writers. And in order
to further minimize the effort required to get started, we have
provided C++ source code for routines that will read and write this
data. In brief summary, section 1 of the data set contains the
activity specifications consisting of name, duration, and resource
requirements; section 2 of the data set contains the precedence
relations between the activities specified in section 1; section 3 of
the data set contains a feasible schedule for the performance of the
activities specified in sections 1 and 2; and finally section 4
contains miscellaneous data found in the following problem
descriptions. C++ source code that implements basic reading and
writing routines for the data found in sections 1, 2, and 3 is
provided in a separate file, courtesy of Mark Ringer.</P>

<P>Any participants that received prior beta copies of this data
should destroy those old data sets and use only the data acquired from
this source. There have been some significant changes since it was
first created. </P>
