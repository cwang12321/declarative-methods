<H1>Planning & Scheduling Benchmarks</H1> 

<H1>Introduction</H1>  	 
 
<P>One of us (Barry) currently serves as benchmarks secretary of the AAAI
Special Interest Group in Manufacturing while the other (Mark) has
similar responsibilities within the AIAA, Artificial Intelligence
Technical Committee. Together we are in the process of preparing a
series of benchmark planning and scheduling problems for publication
over the Internet. The first of these problems has been completed and
is described in a separate document. In the future we hope to provide
a variety of problems, all based upon real applications. Because of
our limited access to industrial problems the selection of problems
that we provide will be limited, but we will do our best to guarantee
that the problems are relevant to a broad range of industries. We will
likely call upon many of our colleagues to help create new problems
and to perform initial tests of the data sets to be published. We hope
that others will follow our lead and provide access to problems in
other domains.<P> We will do our best to provide a variety of both
planning and scheduling problems. By doing so we hope to illustrate
the need for well integrated planning and scheduling systems that
support the entire life-cycle of product design, process design,
manufacturing, and distribution. There is no expectation that all
participants will attempt to solve all of the published
problems. Instead, it is likely that each participant will focus in
the area of their greatest expertise and interest.</P>

<P> This is clearly an experiment. We have no way to predict what kind
of participation will result from the publication of these problems
nor to predict any downstream effects on the course of research and
development. We will make every attempt to be responsive to comments
and suggestions submitted by participants and we will change the
content and format if necessary. Continuation and expansion are
entirely dependent upon the interest shown by participants and the
time required to maintain this home page, data sets, and submitted
results.  To the best of our ability, we will keep this forum open
until December 31, 1995.  </P>

<P>Good Luck!<BR>

<H1>Objectives</H1>  	

<P>The number one purpose for publication of these problems is to
accelerate the development and deployment of planning and scheduling
technology that will have a significant impact in industry. In order
to achieve this purpose, we have sought to satisfy the following
objectives: </P>

<ol>

<li>The problems must be relevant to industry. The emphasis will be on
the ability to produce good solutions to realistic problems rather
than on the ability to produce optimal solutions to abstract problems.</li>

<li>The problems must be realistic. They should be based upon or
derived from real industrial planning and scheduling problems. They
should not be made either easier or harder to accommodate the
capabilities or goals of the research community.</li>

<li> The problems must advance the state of the practice. They should
contain some features or attributes that challenge mainstream
commercial products.</li>

<li> The problems must advance the state of the art. They should
contain some features or attributes that challenge mainstream research
results.</li>

<li> The problems must be public. They must be freely distributable
and easily accessible over the Internet.</li>

<li>The problems must be open to all who wish to
participate. Professors, graduate students, government and industrial
laboratories, and commercial solution providers are all encouraged to
participate.</li>

<li>The cost of entry should be low. The data should be easy to
read and interpret. Participants should not need to invest a
significant amount of effort in developing code to import and export
problem data.</li>

<li>Practitioners at all levels of ability should be able to
participate. The problems should be delivered in a graduated series so
that participants can begin with simple cases and incrementally work
their way to more challenging instances.</li>

<li> There should be some reward for participation. The solutions
submitted by participants should be quickly and openly published so
that all participants can easily compare their performance to others
and can easily advertise their accomplishments.</li>

<li> There should be some
mechanism for participants to publish comments on the problems sets,
papers describing their own research, summaries of their products and
services, and even problem sets of their own design.</li>

</ol>

<dt> March 6, 1995 </dt>
<dd> Planning & Scheduling Benchmarks Homepage posted at<br> 
     "ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/users/b/benchmrx/homepage.html"</dd>
<dt> March 8, 1995 </dt>
<dd> Simple solutions to the first 4 problems of Resource Constrained Project Scheduling are
     provided by Mark Ringer. </dd>
<dt> March 14, 1995 </dt>
<dd> Final revisions applied. Planning & Scheduling Benchmarks publicly announced. </dd>
<dt> March 28, 1995 </dt>
<dd> No results have been submitted yet, but in addition to Browser and FTP access we
     have mailed data sets to 16 different individuals with addresses that circle the globe.
     We are told by some of our colleagues that these problems are being used in a 
     variety of graduate level courses and seminars on scheduling. 
     <A HREF="mailto:benchmrx@neosoft.com">Don't forget to write home!</A> </dd>
<dt> April 15, 1995 </dt>
<dd> The neosoft web server has been upgraded from ftp to http. Please note
     the new web address: "http://www.neosoft.com/~benchmrx" Some of the 
     documentation and the web page has been revised slightly to facilitate
     future maintenance. A typographical error was corrected for  
     Mark Ringer's solution to RCPS Problem 1. </dd>
<dt> April 20, 1995 </dt>
<dd> One official result has been received and validated(see below). 
     Several organizations are actively working on the problems and several 
     of their solutions have been submitted for validation. Don't forget
     to make an official submission for posting on the Planning & 
     Scheduling Benchmarks homepage. </dd>
<dt> June 15, 1995 </dt>
<dd> SAS Institute has submitted validated solutions to the first 5 problems.
     Other organizations have been working on the problems but have not
     made official submissions to benchmrx@neosoft.com. Be sure to submit
     your results!
<dt> July 13, 1995 </dt>
<dd> A major aerospace corporation has decided to use the benchmark problems
     as part of their evaluation of suppliers of scheduling software. 
     Although this site was not established for this specific purpose, this
     is clearly consistent with its objectives and will certainly enable 
     the customer to make a more informed decision. With a few reasonable
     restricitions, we encourage such use of the benchmarks and would be
     happy to support similar efforts by other companies. </dd>

<H1>Problems</H1>

<H1>Resource Constrained Project Scheduling</H1>
<P> This data set, and its associated series of problems, is based
upon large scale assembly but is applicable to a wide variety of
problems in engineering, construction, and manufacturing that can
generally be described as resource constrained project
scheduling. This same data set and series of problems could have
originated from a commercial construction project, a petro-chemical
plant start-up, an automotive assembly line set-up, Space Shuttle
reprocessing, or the assembly of heavy machine tools. We have prepared
a first series of problems based upon this data set. Time permitting,
we will prepare additional problems that are based upon this same data
set or prepare additional data sets that can be the subject of this
same series of problems. An overview of the problem set is provided 
in an online html document. The complete problem set is provided
in ascii, postscript, and Microsoft Word format. </P>

<P>In order to give participants a reference point, Mark Ringer has
solved the first 4 problems of Resource Constrained Project Scheduling
using a simple first fit, feasible interval based algorithm with *no*
optimization. The results are summarized below and the actual
solutions are provided as data files that can be downloaded.</P>

<H2>General Topics</H2>

<dl>
<dt> How can I download these files to my local machine?</dt>
<dd> See the notes on FTP Access below, or set the "Load to local disk"
     option within your web browser and visit the files that you wish
     to capture.</dd>
<dt> How can I print the postscript files?</dt>
<dd> Just send them to a postscript printer using your normal print command.</dd>
<dt> Why won't the postscript files print!?</dt>
<dd> Some European participants have reported that the postscript files will only
     print on 8.5x11 inch paper.  Some new EPS format postscript files have
     been created. Please let us know if they do not print on larger format paper.</dd>
